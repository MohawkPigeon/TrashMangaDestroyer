Currently works in https://manganato.com/genre-all by selecting a minumum value it will delete any results below that.
The value reset button on the extenesion does not currrently work due to security issues.
You can manualy delete the cookie to reset the value.

Setup: To get it working go to chrome://extensions/ enable developer mode and load the extension by downloading the project and selecting the folder.
